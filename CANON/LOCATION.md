# Location Profile

**Star Rating:** 4.2

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Not at the hostel - on a remote trail 4 hours away. Mirador de los Condores (Condor Viewpoint) - a scenic overlook accessed by a challenging trail rarely used by tourists. The viewpoint is a natural rock platform with a 200-foot drop to jagged rocks below. No guardrail, no signage, no witnesses. Body lands in a narrow ravine that requires technical climbing to access.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Elena
**Description:** 45-year-old local woman, raised in Ollantaytambo, knows every trail and every danger. Warm but practical, pushes coca tea on everyone. Has a sixth sense for bad intentions.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - told Hannah the trail was dangerous, offered a guide. Was ignored. Will blame herself for not insisting.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria | Elena's sister, notices everything, saw Hannah's coldness |
| Security | None | Community polices itself |
| Kitchen | Carlos | Elena's husband, former mountain guide, could have saved Charlie |
| Manager | Elena | Owner-operator, knows the mountains better than anyone |

### Staff Knowledge
Elena sensed something wrong about Hannah but couldn't articulate it. Maria specifically mentioned to Elena that Hannah was "different when Charlie wasn't looking." They discuss this guilt-riddenly after the "accident."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Quiet and purposeful. Trekkers preparing for or recovering from hikes. Coca tea drinking. Map studying. Gear comparing. The pleasant exhaustion of adventure travel.

### Night Vibe
Communal and warm. Travelers gather around the fire pit, sharing stories. Early nights because of early mornings and altitude. Intimate conversations under impossibly starry skies.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of:
- Machu Picchu trekkers on the Inca Trail or alternatives
- Day hikers exploring the Sacred Valley
- Gap year travelers doing South America
- Older adventure travelers taking it slow
- Spiritual tourists seeking "authentic" experiences

### Reputation
4.5 stars on HostelWorld - "Best hostel in the Sacred Valley!" "Elena is an angel." "Feels like family." One review from two years ago: "Beautiful but the remote trails can be dangerous. Know your limits."

## Real-World Research

- Remote trail deaths do occur in the Sacred Valley
- The Andean condor does nest in these cliffs

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Portray local Peruvians as knowledgeable, not props
