**Occupation:** Gap year student (deferred from Cambridge)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Gap Year Kid

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Naivety

**How it manifests:**
- Believes money doesn't matter to "real" friendships
- Overshares financial information to seem relatable
- Can't fathom that someone would befriend her for ulterior motives
- Guilt about privilege makes her easy to manipulate

**How it kills them:**

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'5", slim, delicate features that broadcast privilege
- **Hair:** Honey blonde, usually in a messy ponytail - trying to look effortless
- **Distinguishing features:** Perfect teeth (expensive orthodontics), small birthmark on left wrist, unconscious posture of private school deportment
- **Typical outfit:** Trying hard not to look wealthy - secondhand-looking clothes that cost a fortune, Birkenstocks, a vintage camera

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Generosity - becomes enabling of exploitation
2. Openness - becomes oversharing that makes her vulnerable

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Guilt about privilege - leads to letting people take advantage
2. Desperate need to be liked for herself - leads to ignoring red flags

### Pet Peeves
- Being treated differently because of money
- People assuming she's snobby
- Having to pay for everything (even though she offers)

### Fears
- Being friendless and alone
- Being seen as just a "rich girl"
- Disappointing her family by failing at independence

## Background

### Origin Story
Only child of a wealthy Surrey family - father in finance, mother on charity boards. Attended boarding school where she was well-liked but always suspected people wanted something from her. Deferred Cambridge to "find herself" and prove she could survive without family money (while having family money as a safety net).

### Why They Travel
To prove she can be "normal," to make friends who like her for her, to have stories that aren't about privilege. Also running from the suffocating expectations of her family.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Met Hannah in Thailand three months ago and they've been inseparable since. Hannah suggested this remote mountain hostel in Peru - perfect for their "adventure before Cambridge calls." Charlie booked it instantly.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "brilliant," "lovely," "proper," "quite," "actually"
- Avoids words like: "expensive," "my parents," "trust fund"
- Catchphrases: "It's not about the money," "I just want to be treated normally"

### Speech Pattern
- Upper-class British accent she tries to soften
- Self-deprecating humor about privilege
- Quick to apologize and defer
- Uptalking when nervous

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant anxiety about being perceived, analyzing whether people really like her, guilt spirals about privilege, desperate optimism about friendships.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 3,200 (mostly school friends and family)
- **Posting style:** Carefully curated "authentic" travel moments that don't show anything expensive
- **Last post before death:** Photo with Hannah: "3 months with this one. Some people just GET you. Peru next!"

### Online vs Reality
Online: Independent adventurer having authentic experiences
Reality: Subsidizing her travel partner's entire trip without admitting it

## Relationships

### Family
- Distant but loving parents who track her location obsessively
- Close to grandmother who gave her the inheritance that will trigger her death

### Friends
- Many acquaintances, few real friends
- Hannah is her first "real" friendship (she thinks)

### Romantic
- Nothing serious, a few hostel flings
- Hannah has been her primary emotional relationship for months

### At the Hostel
- Gets along with everyone
- Other travelers notice Hannah's controlling behavior before Charlie does
- Staff find her polite but unaware

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Woke up excited for the hike Hannah planned - just the two of them, remote mountain trail. Transferred $5,000 to Hannah to "hold for emergencies" at Hannah's suggestion.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Laughing with Hannah at breakfast, feeling grateful for their friendship, planning their next destination. Genuinely happy.

### Final Thoughts
Confusion, then horrified realization as Hannah's face changes. The devastating understanding that none of it was real. Thinking of her mother.

### Last Words
"Hannah... I don't understand... I thought we were friends..."
